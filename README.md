# CloverOS Website Redesign Proposal

### Overview
The current website needed redesigning, so I took it as an opportunity to learn more about design and composition. The website is mostly plain html/css with no external js libraries, just a few lines of purejs.

### Features
- No external JS libraries utilized, all JS functionality encapsulated in a single 878byte purejs file.
- Pure html/css automatic fallback if JS is not available by default.
- Improved design composition, presentation and overall functionality.
- Cleaner code, should be easier to modify.
- Mobile friendly.


### Todo
* Some content on the site is filler, needs to be completed.
